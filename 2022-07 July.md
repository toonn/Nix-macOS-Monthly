# July 2022

I'm down to only a handful of source releases that still need bumping. `Libc` still requires one older version because Apple stopped shipping certain headers. The `pkill` and `pgrep` commands of `adv_cmds` still do not build, but `colldef` and `mklocale` do. One of the bigger challenges was `network_cmds`, it depends on OpenSSL. However, Apple's OpenSSL for macOS 10.13 was at version 0.9.8. The `network_cmds` in Nixpkgs is currently built with OpenSSL 1.0.2 but the new version wasn't compatible anymore. Rather than go back to Apple's older version, [I patched `network_cmds` for compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.0](https://github.com/toonn/nixpkgs/commit/da1a69430cf399d46ffb044f4b3b84e2558b0317). Eyes on this would be appreciated.

In other news, @reckenrode :heart: [made it possible to use the 11.0 SDK on x86_64-darwin](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/176661)! This was prompted by their work on MoltenVK and additionally motivated by Go 1.18 requiring a newer SDK, not to mention various other projects like Python and Qt. For now the intent is for this to be used sparingly, only for cases where it's unavoidable.
