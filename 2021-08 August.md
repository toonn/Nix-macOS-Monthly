# August 2021

At the start of the month I finished up some work on the [LLVM bump](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/126411).
I patched Libc to define `TARGET_OS_EMBEDDED` if it is not defined because LLVM 11 is stricter about the use of undefined identifiers.
I also updated the libpulseaudio expression to build without impurities.
This should take care of most of the major breakages introduced by the LLVM update.
I'm currently waiting for a Hydra evaluation to confirm this but the x86_64 Darwin builders are swamped by a stdenv rebuild due to an OpenSSL update and Haskell packages updates.

Most of my time was spent on troubleshooting the configd build, still working on [this branch](https://github.com/toonn/Nixpkgs/tree/apple_sdk-bump) though I've been going back and forth on changes recently, have yet to distill them into commits to push.
Updating the Apple source releases is an integral part of bumping the SDK version, in Nixpkgs they are an amalgam of packages from different version of macOS, our XNU has header from two versions of XNU, for example, and Security and configd haven't gotten updated for several major versions of macOS.
Setting out to update all of them to the versions available for macOS 10.13.6 I quickly ran into stumbling blocks.
Some packages have changed considerably, in the case of hfs I decided not to pursue updating it now because it would be too time consuming, most of the old headers simply aren't present in the newer release and it's not clear what it does provide now.
Configd has also proven to be rather difficult, it uses functions that are missing unless `-DPRIVATE` or `-DKERNEL` are provided but neither of these seems to be intended for third-party builds, the Makefile only provides `-D__OPEN_SOURCE__`.
With both those flags configd starts depending on headers from Neon, a C HTTP/WebDAV client library implementation, which is available on [opensource.apple.com](https://opensource.apple.com/source/neon/) but we can only guess at the version that corresponds to a certain version of macOS.

This means the source releases Apple provides aren't necessarily even buildable and I'll probably hold off on updating configd as a consequence.
During this troubleshooting I did find out the `AvailabilityInternal.h` header Apple provides in the XNU sources is no longer updated since macOS 10.12.6.
Systems running later versions of macOS do have an updated header locally but the open source release is missing several definitions used by other open source releases.
I originally tried fixing this by patching the missing definitions into the header, which could be done programmatically, but I quickly realized why Apple changed to a different definition for availability macros, the old approach leads to a combinatorial explosion of definitions for all combinations of macOS versions, the header on my system has 10k more lines than the header in the open source release and this difference would only get bigger with newer versions.
So instead I opted to update the relatively fewer places where the old-style availability macros were used for newer versions to using the newer macros.
This made it possible to update Security, which was at the version corresponding to macOS 10.9.5 with a note stating it was to be updated as soon as the problems were figured out, 4 major versions of macOS later I think we did it : )
