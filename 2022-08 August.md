# August 2022

I've bumped all of the Apple source releases, `configd` being the main missing piece. For now we will stick with `SystemConfiguration` from the Apple SDK as a substitute. This time around, `system_cmds` was the most troublesome project. I ended up having to drop `gcore`, `lskq`, `lsmp` and `zprint but managed to fix the builds for `dirhelper`, `dmesg`, `dynamic_pager`, `ltop`, `pagesize`, `proc_uuid_policy`, `taskpolicy` and `vm_purgeable_stat`, it remains to be seen whether those are requirements for any packages.

The next step is to do a full rebuild on Hydra to check how many failures are introduced by these changes. And then things need to go through review.  I'd especially appreciate more eyes on the [changes to `network_cmds` related to OpenSSL](https://github.com/toonn/nixpkgs/commit/da1a69430cf399d46ffb044f4b3b84e2558b0317). @veprbl already pointed out an initialization issue but I'm sure this can use more scrutiny.

One current technical hurdle is Hydra is not currently building bootstrap-tools, but this is being worked on in [PR #183072](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/183072).
