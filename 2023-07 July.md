# July 2023

[The stdenv LLVM bump](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/241692) is [progressing](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/234710). Shout-outs to @reckenrode and everyone chipping in!

I've continued splitting the SDK bump into smaller branches. One snag has been bumping the SDK itself, which dtrace depends on (in later versions we might be able to drop that dependency again), leading to a bit of a circular dependency situation because the SDK requires the stdenv and part of the stdenv requires the SDK.
