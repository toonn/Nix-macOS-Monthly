# May 2021

This month was spent getting the bootstrap-tools and stdenv to build with LLVM 11. This required quite a few patches essentially flipping clang switches back to the clang-7 behavior, like `-fcommon`.
I based this work on staging, which got the Apple Silicon PR merged in time for the 21.05 release, in an attempt to make it in the release as well but got stuck on two regressions introduced in that PR.
These were quickly patched by @thefloweringash :heart:.
On @LnL's advice I've rebased [the LLVM bump PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/121055) on a specific Nixpkgs master commit so we can have a hydra jobset that compares well with existing evaluations and finish up this work.

In other news, [the Apple Silicon PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/105026) was merged in time for release 21.05 :tada:.
This means we're getting really close to officially supporting Aarch64 macs, pending some fixes to enable Aarch64 hydra builds and a Nix release.
There has also been progress on [getting NixOS tests to run virtualized on Darwin](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/108984#issuecomment-842192023) by @r2r-dev.
