# April 2022

Something that stood out with the `_scproxy` issue was the involvement of a bootstrap stage Python in the `bootstrapped-pip` build. This raised my suspicion that something was wrong with the Python build. Turns out there were errors preventing `_scproxy.c` from being compiled but these errors were silently swallowed and did not result in a failing build.

The reason for the errors was an issue with the Availability macros. Apple stopped updating them in the open source releases, probably because of the combinatorial explosion of macros with each new version of macOS. They've since switched to newer macros, which are backed by the `availability` attribute in modern Clang and GCC.

My fix is redefining the old macros using the new-style `availability` attribute. This finally fixed the Python build and completed the substitution of `configd` by `SystemConfiguration` from the SDK. Now I can continue bumping Apple's open source releases.
