Hi, I'm working on macOS support in Nixpkgs, sponsored by the
[Nix ðŸ–¤ macOS Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nix-macos).
I'm a long-time macOS user and started using Nix almost 4 years ago.

This thread's intended to be a place for monthly status updates on what
I've been working on and community feedback of painpoints macOS users
experience.

# March 2021

I started tracking the state of macOS in issue
[#116341 Status of macOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/116341).
It's a convenient place to keep track of known issues. I try to keep it
up to date on an overview level.

Nixpkgs currently uses macOS SDK version 10.12. This is fairly old and it
is starting to generate issues where newer software can't be built for
macOS because it relies on features in newer SDKs. The first goal is to
get this updated. I've been working on
[bumping it to 10.13](https://github.com/toonn/Nixpkgs/tree/apple_sdk-bump),
the last version my local machine supports, as a way to familiarize myself
with the process. This should make it easier to update to at least 10.14,
the oldest version still supported by Apple, and likely newer versions using
cloud resources. I've gotten the first three stages of the Darwin stdenv
bootstrap to build (there's 4 bootstrap stages and 1 final stage).
