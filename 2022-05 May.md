With `configd` out of the way I was finally able to focus on bumping the actual Apple open source releases we rely on to construct our own source-based SDK.  This went swimmingly. I've updated about half of the source releases and tracked down some of the headers we were missing, so our SDK will be more complete. So far I haven't encountered any major, new roadblocksâ€”*knock on wood*.
