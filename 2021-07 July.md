# July 2021

This month was spent focusing on the LLVM bump. [The latest Hydra Evaluation](https://hydra.nixos.org/eval/1689351?compare=1677022&full=#tabs-now-fail) is promising.
I managed to fix libtiff, cups, mariadb, mariadb-connector-c, portaudio, fltk, Qt5 WebEngine, Curio, vault, groonga and sphinx and wheel required new FOD hashes.
The most common build failure in this latest evaluation is icoutils and fixing it required a patch to Libc which has revealed an impurity in the build for libpulseaudio, two steps forward, one step back.
But we're getting closer to an LLVM 11 stdenv on Darwin.
If there's packages in the evaluation that are failing to build but are important to you, patches are welcome.

I also looked into why [Firefox fails to build on Darwin](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/53979).
First stumbling block is jemalloc and I'm [talking to maintainers](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/2091).
So as a temporary workaround I've uploaded [the expression I use](https://github.com/toonn/nur-packages/blob/master/pkgs/darwin/apps/firefox/default.nix), which fetches the latest app in a dmg from [mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), to [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#installation).
Making use of this should be as simple as putting an override in your config:

```nix
{
  nixpkgs.config.packageOverrides = pkgs: {
    nur = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/master.tar.gz") {
      inherit pkgs;
    };
  };
}
```

And then you can use `nur.repos.toonn.apps.firefox` to install the package.
(For setups without nix-darwin take a look at the [NUR installation instructions](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR#installation).)
The expression has a version argument so itâ€™s possible to install a specific Firefox version, every version since 86.0, like so, `nur.repos.toonn.apps.firefox.override { version = "86.0"; }`.
